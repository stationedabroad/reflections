Compare files using diff -u OLD_FILE NEW_FILE in linux or FC in windows
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Qucikyl allowed me to home in on only the differences

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Allows me to track changes, and understand a piece of codes history (hopefully)

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: you can decide the logical commit when it suits your function
    Cons: You can oviously forget to commit, and it mayget unwieldy

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Multiple version saving aids in programming and development tasks.  Whereas
    Google docs are more general purpose and don't really count on repository style
    saves needing to take place.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log used to show history of commits, git diff used to display differences
    between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Much more confident since i can revert back to a commit before the bug occured.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To organise code
