What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	Git sets the current directory with a .git dir ready to be tracked.  This needs to be done
	if you want to version control and track changes to this directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? 
What value do you think it offers?


	Staging area is a temporary storage before a commit, collating files which
	you will ultimately want to commit in a new version.  Working directory is just the 
	directory you are currently working in and the repository is the collection
	of files which are linked in commits.

How can you use to staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	You can work changes to the files concerned, then one by one add to the staging
	area, then before you commit you can see the logical changes made to the files.
