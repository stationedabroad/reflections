What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	Git sets the current directory with a .git dir ready to be tracked.  This needs to be done
	if you want to version control and track changes to this directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? 
What value do you think it offers?


	Staging area is a temporary storage before a commit, collating files which
	you will ultimately want to commit in a new version.  Working directory is just the 
	directory you are currently working in and the repository is the collection
	of files which are linked in commits.
